# Avidity Supply

For my Milestone Project 4 with Code Institute, I designed a website called Avidity Supply, inspired by a business my cousin and I started when we were younger, focused on creating minimalist street apparel, particularly hats.

To bring this vision to life, I utilized several tools and technologies: Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The result is a functional, elegant e-commerce platform that showcases our streetwear designs with simplicity and sophistication.
